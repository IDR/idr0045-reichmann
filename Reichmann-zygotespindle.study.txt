Study Title	Dual spindle formation in zygotes keeps parental genomes apart in early mammalian embryos
Study Type	# leave blank			
Study Type Term Source REF	# leave blank			
Study Type Term Accession	# leave blank			
Study Description	At the beginning of mammalian life the genetic material from each parent meets when the fertilized egg divides. It was previously thought that a single microtubule spindle is responsible to spatially combine the two genomes and then segregate them to create the two-cell embryo. Utilizing light-sheet microscopy, we showed that two bipolar spindles form in the zygote, which independently congress the maternal and paternal genomes. These two spindles aligned their poles prior to anaphase but kept the parental genomes apart during the first cleavage. This spindle assembly mechanism provides a potential rationale for erroneous divisions into more than two blastomeric nuclei observed in mammalian zygotes and reveals the mechanism behind the observation that parental genomes occupy separate nuclear compartments in the two-cell embryo.

Experiment Description	Zygotes were isolated from C57BL/6J x C3H/He F1 females mated with C57BL/6J x C3H/He F1 males. Embryos were injected with mRNA for expression of EB3-mCherry and tdEos-Cep192. Embryos were imaged with 45 sec time resolution on an inverted light sheet microscope (doi: 10.1038/nmeth.3690) at 130nm xy and 520nm z resolution using 488 and 561 laser lines.

Protocol Description	Mouse embryos were collected from superovulated (injection of 7.5 international units (IU) pregnant mare serum followed by injection of 7.5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin 42 to 50 hours later) 8- to 24-week-old female mice according to the guidelines of EMBL Laboratory Animal Resources. Embryos were cultured in 30-μl drops of G1 medium (Vitrolife) covered by mineral oil (Ovoil, Vitrolife) with 5% CO2 and 5% O2 atmosphere.
